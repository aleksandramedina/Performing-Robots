## Final Project Journal

- Select a song or poem, and outline the story line for your performance

**Song idea:** *Baby It's Cold Outside* by Idina Menzel and Michael Bubl√©

- Consider which character (or characters) your robot will play
- How will you construct it
  - Costume
- What will be the technical requirements (movements, graphics, sound)
- How will you get around the technical limitations we've discussed (imprecise movements, poor quality sound, etc.)
- Consider the staging
  - Set (if any)
  - Lighting (if any)
  - Greenscreen and alternate background (if any)
- Consider the action
