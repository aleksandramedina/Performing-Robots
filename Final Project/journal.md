## Final Project Journal

- Select a song or poem, and outline the story line for your performance

**Song idea:** [Baby It's Cold Outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bbuBubZ1yE) by Idina Menzel and Michael Bubl√© (until the end of the first chorus).

- Consider which character (or characters) your robot will play

My robot will play the two lead characters - the female and the male. By filming two takes (once only the male character and once only the female character), I will be able to have the same robot play both characters. Costuming here will be key. 

- How will you construct it
  - Costume
  
  Since my robot playing Ophelia from Hamlet was extremely antropomorphic, I want these two characters be less so. This will also help me with the problems I've been having with balancing my robots. To do this, I will keep them closer to the ground and wider, which will make them more stable. I will keep the 'body' of the robot the same and use costuming as a way to differentiate the two characters.
  
- What will be the technical requirements (movements, graphics, sound)
  - small movements since the two robots will be playing two lovers having a conversation
    - little turns left and right, back and forth
  - sound will be the song, which will be broken up into a dialogue between the two characters
    - this can come from my computer or added afterwards to the video when editing
  - still not sure if I want to use any visuals
    - potentially could use a graphic on the female character to express that she is cold
- How will you get around the technical limitations we've discussed (imprecise movements, poor quality sound, etc.)
  - Sound: I will add it to the video, when editing
  - Imprecise movements: I will use small movements (since it is a conversation), leave enough space for the robots and plan the scene so that an imprecise movement won't be obviously out of place
- Consider the staging
  - Set (if any)
    - My living room, in front of the fireplace

  - Lighting (if any)
    - Considering to light the fireplace. Otherwise imitate a fireplace effect.
    
    
## November 16 - in class feedback session

- Why am I presenting this through robots?

To present the controversy around the song and the sentiment of a classic Christmas song by removing the painful historic context of human genders.

- Action represnts emotion
- Context of the two machines
  - Juxtaposing the coziness of the background (represeting the general love people still have towards the song) and the bleakness, metallic look of the robots (the #MeToo movement)
  - romantic comedy situation
    - exploring the #MeToo movement through robots: Why can't the robot leave?
      - its cable is tangled
      - the battery is dead
      - the code is broken
