## Final Project Journal

- Select a song or poem, and outline the story line for your performance

**Song idea:** *Baby It's Cold Outside* by Idina Menzel and Michael Bubl√© (until the end of the first chorus).

- Consider which character (or characters) your robot will play

My robot will play the two lead characters - the female and the male. By filming two takes (once only the male character and once only the female character), I will be able to have the same robot play both characters. Costuming here will be key. 

- How will you construct it
  - Costume
  
  Since my robot playing Ophelia from Hamlet was extremely antropomorphic, I want these two characters be less so. This will also help me with the problems I've been having with balancing my robots. To do this, I will keep them closer to the ground and wider, which will make them more stable. I will keep the 'body' of the robot the same and use costuming as a way to differentiate the two characters.
  
- What will be the technical requirements (movements, graphics, sound)
  - small movements since the two robots will be playing two lovers having a conversation
    - little turns left and right, back and forth
- How will you get around the technical limitations we've discussed (imprecise movements, poor quality sound, etc.)
- Consider the staging
  - Set (if any)
  - Lighting (if any)
  - Greenscreen and alternate background (if any)
- Consider the action
