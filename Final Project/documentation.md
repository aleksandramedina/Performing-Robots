# Final Project - A Robot Christmas

### What is it?

The performance is set to the song [Baby it's cold outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bbuBubZ1yE) by Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé. It involves two robot characters played by the same robot performer. An additional representation of the robot is built as a stand in for the scenes.


Many know this song as a sentimental and traditional sound of Christmas, however, the song has recently come under attack (rightfully so) for its extremely sexist lyrics. Artists like Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé have tried to remove the context of the song by replacing adult characters in the song's video by children. However, I thought this would be a great example where to introduce robot performers to offer a new spin to the classic song and its problematic context.


The video is shot with a lit fireplace as a backdrop. The coziness of the set is juxtaposed with the robot's metallic appearance and simplistic shape. It is literally just a metallic rectangle omitting any gender associations that the song references. The robots translate their inner processes by printing OLED messages that we often encounter when coding, such as:

- "stuck in an infinite loop",
- "problem detected",
- "forced approach".

This process allows me to take a serious issue and deliver it in a light and comedic spirit while still presenting a strong commentary of the cultural context the song carries.

### The process

**Building the robot**


First I started with building the robot. The shape and material used were based on the artistic decision to make the robot as non-antropomorphic as possible and to also allow for easy access to the components during the building process. I used a shipping box as the robot's body and then wrapped it in aluminum foil. For the robot stand-in I used a shoe box and wrapped it in aluminum foil too. The box structure allowed me easy access to the components hidden inside by lifting the cover. The box also served for maximized stability. To further increase the stability of the robot and avoid it leaning too much to the front, I also attached the cardboard part of a toilet paper roll. The finalized robot had two wheels attached to each horizontal side of the box, a button and an OLED screen on the top.


**Script**

Next I wrote the script and planned for each movement and action that should happen. I took the lyrics, wrote down time codes for each line and noted actions that should happen when the respective line is sung. 


**Lyrics:**

(0:10) I really can't stay **<- Male: doesn't move; female slowly comes into the shot (0-15 seconds)**

Baby, it's cold outside **<- Male: wiggles**

(0:15) I've got to go away **<- Message: "Something seems wrong." female: turns 180 degrees** 

Baby, it's cold outside **<- Male: wiggles**

This evening has been

(0:20) Been hoping that you'd drop in **<- message: "mission successful" male: wiggles**

So very nice 

I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry **<- female goes back & forth**

(0:32) Beautiful, what's your hurry? **<- message: "problem detected"**

My father will be pacing the floor

Listen to that fire place roar

(0:35) So really I'd better scurry **<- message: "can't find safety: abort" female: stops **

Beautiful, please don't hurry **<- male: goes straight**

(0:40) But maybe just a half a drink more **<- Error: Low on battery. female start slowly turning / changing directions**

(0:43) I'll put some records on while I pour **<- message: "Error 1: resolved" male: wiggles**

The neighbors might think **female "paces"**

Baby, it's bad out there

(0:48) Say what's in this drink? **<- Error: Power source seems incompatible.**

No cabs to be had out there 

I wish I knew how

Your eyes are like starlight now

To break this spell

I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no no no

(01:05) Mind if I move in closer? **<- message: "Trying forced approach" male: goes forward**

(01:05) At least i'm gonna say that I tried **<- Error: Stuck in an infinite loop." female starts spinning faster**

What's the sense in hurting my pride?

I really can't stay

Baby, don't hold out

Baby it's cold outside

(01:17)


**Set**

The set was illuminated by four light sources:
- the fire place in the back
- ceiling lamp for overall luminosity
- floor lamp to add more focus to the 'stage'
- extra intensity garden lamp as a spot light

**Filming**

All of the filming was done in four takes:
- first: character I OLED messages shot with an iPhone 
- second: character II OLED messages shot with an iPhone 
- third: character I movements shot with a GoPro
- fourth: character II movements shot with a GoPro


The set-up while filming the two movement videos included a GoPro camera put on top of a stack of books.
