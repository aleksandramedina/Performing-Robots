# Final Project - A Robot Christmas

### What is it?

The performance is set to the song [Baby it's cold outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bbuBubZ1yE) by Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé. It involves two robot characters played by the same robot performer. An additional representation of the robot is built as a stand in for the scenes.


Many know this song as a sentimental and traditional sound of Christmas, however, the song has recently come under attack (rightfully so) for its extremely sexist lyrics. Artists like Idina Menzel and Michael Bublé have tried to remove the context of the song by replacing adult characters in the song's video by children. However, I thought this would be a great example where to introduce robot performers to offer a new spin to the classic song and its problematic contect.


The video is shot with a lit fireplace as a backdrop. The coziness of the set is juxtaposed with the robot's metallic appearance and simplistic shape. It is literally just a metallic rectangle omitting any gender associations that the song references. The robots translate their inner processes by printing messages that we often encounter when coding, such as:

- "stuck in an infinite loop",
- "problem detected",
- "forced approach".

This process allows me to take a serious issue and deliver it in a light and comedic way while still presenting a strong commentary of the cultural context the song carries.
