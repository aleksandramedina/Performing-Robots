## In class exercise

The performance is based on the "Baby it's cold outside" song until the end of the first time both parts share the "Baby it's cold outside"
line together; adding up to 1 minute 15 seconds.


**Script:** The text will be broken into parts when post-editing so that there are longer breaks between each character's line. This will help me to align it with the robot's movements.

**Set:** my libing room, in front of the fireplace. The set is very cute and cozy, in start contrast with the metallic box shaped robots who are the main characters.

**Lighting:** lit fire place, the ceiling light (just to make sure it's not completely dark) and a table lamp for extra dramatic shadows.

**Robot:**
- costume: done
- display: prints error messages as 'emotions', e.g. when the female voice sings about being worried, the display would say: "error: no comfort found"
- movement: imitating the little dance / shuffle movements of the original video. At the end the robots get physically stuck together so one of them physically can't leave (or an error message is printed: "error: the temparature is too low, cannot operate"


### Detailed scenario

**Lyrics:**

(0:10) I really can't stay **<- Male: doesn't move; female slowly comes into the shot (0-15 seconds)**

Baby, it's cold outside **<- Male: wiggles**

(0:15) I've got to go away **<- Message: "Something seems wrong." female: turns 180 degrees** 

Baby, it's cold outside **<- Male: wiggles**

This evening has been

(0:20) Been hoping that you'd drop in **<- message: "mission successful" male: wiggles**

So very nice 

I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry **<- female goes back & forth**

(0:28) Beautiful, what's your hurry? **<- message: "problem detected"**

My father will be pacing the floor

Listen to that fire place roar

(0:35) So really I'd better scurry **<- message: "can't find safety: abort" female: stops **

Beautiful, please don't hurry **<- male: goes straight**

(0:40) But maybe just a half a drink more **<- Error: Low on battery. female start slowly turning / changing directions**

(0:41) I'll put some records on while I pour **<- message: "Error 1: resolved" male: wiggles**

The neighbors might think **female "paces"**

Baby, it's bad out there

(0:48) Say what's in this drink? **<- Error: Power source seems incompatible.**

No cabs to be had out there 

I wish I knew how

Your eyes are like starlight now

To break this spell

I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no no no

(01:03) Mind if I move in closer? **<- message: "Trying forced approach" male: goes forward**

(01:05) At least i'm gonna say that I tried **<- Error: Stuck in an infinite loop." female starts spinning faster**

What's the sense in hurting my pride?

I really can't stay

Baby, don't hold out

Baby it's cold outside

(01:17)
