## In class exercise

The performance is based on the "Baby it's cold outside" song until the end of the first time both parts share the "Baby it's cold outside"
line together; adding up to 1 minute 15 seconds.


**Script:** The text will be broken into parts when post-editing so that there are longer breaks between each character's line. This will help me to align it with the robot's movements.

**Set:** my libing room, in front of the fireplace. The set is very cute and cozy, in start contrast with the metallic box shaped robots who are the main characters.

**Lighting:** lit fire place, the ceiling light (just to make sure it's not completely dark) and a table lamp for extra dramatic shadows.

**Robot:**
- costume: done
- display: prints error messages as 'emotions', e.g. when the female voice sings about being worried, the display would say: "error: no comfort found"
- movement: imitating the little dance / shuffle movements of the original video. At the end the robots get physically stuck together so one of them physically can't leave (or an error message is printed: "error: the temparature is too low, cannot operate"


### Detailed scenario

**Lyrics:**

I really can't stay

Baby, it's cold outside

I've got to go away **< error message 1**

Baby, it's cold outside

This evening has been

Been hoping that you'd drop in

So very nice

I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry

Beautiful, what's your hurry?

My father will be pacing the floor

Listen to that fire place roar

So really I'd better scurry

Beautiful, please don't hurry

But maybe just a half a drink more

I'll put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think

Baby, it's bad out there

Say what's in this drink?

No cabs to be had out there

I wish I knew how

Your eyes are like starlight now

To break this spell

I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no no no

Mind if I move in closer?

At least i'm gonna say that I tried

What's the sense in hurting my pride?

I really can't stay

Baby, don't hold out

Baby it's cold outside
