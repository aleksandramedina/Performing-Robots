# Lesson Notes & Answers to Questions

## Lesson 1

**Q:** What do you think of when you hear 'robot'?

When I hear of the word 'robot', I tihink of something that has been created as a tool to automate repetitive and boring tasks that humans don't want to deal with themselves. The first thing that pops into my head is something big and bulky like something you'd see in an automobile factory.

**Q:** What is a performance?

Something planned ahead, made to evoke emotions and convey a message to the audience.
