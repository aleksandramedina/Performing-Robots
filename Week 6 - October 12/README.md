## My Robot

### Treat dispenser

I decided to make a robot that dispenses treats to my dog Toby.

This code requires the user to push the button to begin the movement. It states "Press the button to give Toby a treat." 
Once the button is pushed the text changes to "Looking for Toby". 
The robot goes straight, looks into one room to its left, looks into another room to its right, until it finally finds Toby. 
It stops and displays "Found Toby. Good Boy."


Unfortunately, my mp3 component is broken so I commented out the code that would have generated audio. 
The idea was to have a recording of barking dogs to create interest in my dog to approach the robot.

Overall, the robot successfully delivered the treat (although I had to program it to go to a specific room so I had to make sure my dog was in the right room).
My dog was a little scared / suspicious of my contraption so he wouldn't eat the treat at first but eventually **trusted** the robot and took the treat!
