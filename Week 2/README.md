## Week 2

**Some questions that I had from this week:**

- Do we have access to lab assisstants as usual? For example, I couldn't figure out the glitch my homework assignment had, so I would have loved to speak to a lab assisstant / Ume / Jack.

- If I am only receiving my tool kit after October 5 (when I arrive home), how can I complete assignments that require these tools? For example, next week's hot glue assignment.

- Is it OK if for now I submit only an Arduino code and post it on GitHub? Or should I do my assignments on GitHub?
