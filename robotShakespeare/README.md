## Shakespeare by Aleksandra's Robot

**Q1:** Which play and scene will your robot reenact?

Play: *Hamlet*

Scene: *Death of Ophelia*


While the play does not directly show us how Ophelia dies, we hear Hamlet's mother, Gertrude, describe her tragic death.

In Act IV scene vii, Gertrude announces to Laertes and Claudius that Ophelia had drowned. She was perched on the bough of a tree with all her flowers when the limb broke and deposited her into the water. 



... Her clothes spread wide;

And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:

Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;

As one incapable of her own distress,

Or like a creature native and indued

Unto that element: but long it could not be

Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,

Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay

To muddy death.



Ophelia drowned because she fell into the water and did not have the will, in her grief,  to save herself. 

**Q2:** Describe your idea.

I wanted to choose a scene that has a dramatic movement incorporated in it, thus I chose Ophelia falling from a tree (easy to replicate with my robot's limited abilities). 
I have decided to use my bathtub as the river, fill it with pillows and cover with a blue sheet (both for a visual effect and to make sure nothing breaks, when my robot falls from the edge).

**Q3:** Videos / photos.

**Finished Ophelia**

I chose to dress Ophelia in all white for two resons. She was the love interest of Hamlet and was portrayed as the pure counterbalance to all ill that was happening in Hamlet's life. Secondly, since we never 'see' her commit suicide (or accidentally drown - open to interpretation), I imagined her to dress in her most beautiful clothes (possibly even a wedding dress she had picked out) and drown herself as she didn't see a future with Hamlet.
