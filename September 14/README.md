# September 14 Assignment

1. Description of concept and how it was conceived.

I wanted button number 1 to initiate a function where LED 1 blinks once, LED 2 blinks once - repeated three times. Button number 2 initiates a function where LED 1 blinks twice, LED 2 blinks twice - repeated three times. 

I wasn't successful in making this. For some reason button 2 by default was always initiated and button 1 doesn't work.
