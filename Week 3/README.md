# Week 3 Readings

## Social Robotics

**Topic:** Examining the Frankenstein Syndrome: An Open-Ended Cross-Cultural Survey

## Towards a Dramaturgy of Robots and Object-Figures by Peter Eckersall

**Q:** To what extent is a robot autonomous versus just being a tool carrying out specific tasks?

**Q:** How can robots be a more effective tool to deliver social critique via theater?

**O:** Is an "actroid" a separate, autonomous entity or just a "copy" of a human?


## Monday: Kid Koala talk

What an interesting talk! I'm now definitely a fan of his (can't believe I hadn't heard of him earlier!).

I think my favorite remark from his talk was when he spoke about what makes us human. It's essentially the same things that constitute the making and enjoying of art.


## Wednesday: Eckersall reading

Notes:
- Tendency to ampromorphise things vs the fear of machines
- Why do we fear robots if we tend to ampromorphise them?

I personally believe it comes from a place of not truly understanding it. We fear the unknown, the ambiguous and the unpredictable.
I thought it was an interesting point that technology is an extension of us so we perceive it in a similar way we perceive ourselves and the world around us.
