- Haven't received my kit either. Still waiting for info to send over to the customs office. I'm missing two things:
    - full description of what's inside the kit
    - the receipt of purchase
- How can I do next week's assignment? Can I turn it in late?
- Example code from class:

```javascript
#define LEFT_MOTOR 0
#define RIGHT_MOTOR 1


void loop()
{

  // stop both motors for 5 seconds
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 0); //stop motor
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 0, 0); //stop motor
  delay(5000);

  //go forward for 10 seconds

  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 200);
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 1, 200);
  delay(10000);

  // turn right just a little

  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 50);
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 0, 25);
  delay(500);

  while (1)
    ;
}
```

### Talk with Tegan



### Liyan's Presentation


**Q1:** How much of the result was purely due to touching as a sense?

Robot touching a human vs a human touching a robot.

**Q2:** Why is people's immediate response to classify robots as untrustworthy?

For the follow-up question that lead from the conversation of how would you react if you met someone, developed a relationship and then found out they were a robot, would anything change?

**Q3 & Q4:** To what degree were the experiments held in a setting favorable to care giving? What if it wasn't a game?

One mistake made by a robot would lead to a drastic loss of trust in them because of the level of expectation from them.

**Q5:** How willing are you to forgive a robot? How much accountability do they hold?

It's the coders.

Is trust universal or is it something personal and changes person to person?

Trusting a company, government etc.

Communication with the robot - antromorphised as well; trusting someone/ something more if you can communicate with it.
