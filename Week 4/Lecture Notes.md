## Monday, September 28

- Haven't received my kit either. Still waiting for info to send over to the customs office. I'm missing two things:
    - full description of what's inside the kit
    - the receipt of purchase
- How can I do next week's assignment? Can I turn it in late?
- Example code from class:

```javascript
#define LEFT_MOTOR 0
#define RIGHT_MOTOR 1


void loop()
{

  // stop both motors for 5 seconds
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 0); //stop motor
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 0, 0); //stop motor
  delay(5000);

  //go forward for 10 seconds

  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 200);
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 1, 200);
  delay(10000);

  // turn right just a little

  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 50);
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 0, 25);
  delay(500);

  while (1)
    ;
}
```

### Talk with Tegan

**My Notes**

>Dramaturgy is a comprehensive exploration of the context in which the play resides... the physical, social, political, and economic environment in which the action takes place, the psychological underpinnings of the characters, the various metaphrical expression in the play of thematic concerns; as well as on the technical consideration of the play as a piece of writing: structure, rhythm, flow, even individual word choices.

**Context, intention, & impact**

- What do you want to say? / What question are you asking?
- How does the structure of the performance support the intention?
- Who is your audience?
- What do you want your audience to experience?
- Who / what is included or empowered?
- Who / what is excluded or erased?
- What is the relationship between the "characters" and the action?
- Why this work now?

**Intention != impact**

### Liyan's Presentation


**Q1:** How much of the result was purely due to touching as a sense?

Robot touching a human vs a human touching a robot.

**Q2:** Why is people's immediate response to classify robots as untrustworthy?

For the follow-up question that lead from the conversation of how would you react if you met someone, developed a relationship and then found out they were a robot, would anything change?

**Q3 & Q4:** To what degree were the experiments held in a setting favorable to care giving? What if it wasn't a game?

One mistake made by a robot would lead to a drastic loss of trust in them because of the level of expectation from them.

**Q5:** How willing are you to forgive a robot? How much accountability do they hold?

It's the coders.

Is trust universal or is it something personal and changes person to person?

Trusting a company, government etc.

Communication with the robot - antromorphised as well; trusting someone/ something more if you can communicate with it.
