## Monday, September 28

- Haven't received my kit either. Still waiting for info to send over to the customs office. I'm missing two things:
    - full description of what's inside the kit
    - the receipt of purchase
- How can I do next week's assignment? Can I turn it in late?
- Example code from class:

```javascript
#define LEFT_MOTOR 0
#define RIGHT_MOTOR 1


void loop()
{

  // stop both motors for 5 seconds
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 0); //stop motor
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 0, 0); //stop motor
  delay(5000);

  //go forward for 10 seconds

  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 200);
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 1, 200);
  delay(10000);

  // turn right just a little

  myMotorDriver.setDrive( LEFT_MOTOR, 0, 50);
  myMotorDriver.setDrive( RIGHT_MOTOR, 0, 25);
  delay(500);

  while (1)
    ;
}
```

### Talk with Tegan

**My Notes**

>Dramaturgy is a comprehensive exploration of the context in which the play resides... the physical, social, political, and economic environment in which the action takes place, the psychological underpinnings of the characters, the various metaphrical expression in the play of thematic concerns; as well as on the technical consideration of the play as a piece of writing: structure, rhythm, flow, even individual word choices.

**Context, intention, & impact**

- What do you want to say? / What question are you asking?
- How does the structure of the performance support the intention?
- Who is your audience?
- What do you want your audience to experience?
- Who / what is included or empowered?
- Who / what is excluded or erased?
- What is the relationship between the "characters" and the action?
- Why this work now?

**Intention != impact**

**Anne Bogart & Tina Landau's Viewpoints**

- Time
    - Tempo
    - Duration
    - Kinesthetic Response
        - the timing in which you respond to the external events of movement and sound
    - Repetition
 - Space
    - Shape
        - The contour or outline of a body. object in space
            - lines
            - curves
            - combination
        - stationary or in movement
        - can be made in 3 forms
            - the object in space
            - the object in relationship to architecture (making a shape)
            - the object in a relationship to other objects (making a shape)
    - Gesture
        - A shape with a beginning, middle, and end
            - Behavioral gesture
                - concrete, physical, observable in reality
                - private & public
            - Expressive gesture
                - emotion, desire, idea, or value
                - abstrace or symbolic
    - Architecture
        - the physical environment in which you are working and how awareness of it affects movement
            - solid mass
            - texture
            - light
            - color
            - sound
    - Spatial Relationship
    - Topography

**Composition** a method for:
- creating new work
- practicing how to select and arrange separate componenets to create a cohesive experience
- generating, defining, and developing ideas
- revealing to ourselves our hidden thoughts
    - impulses and ideas emerging from limitations on time and/ or scale
- strengthening trust in our impulses (our creative voice)
- being in dialogue with different forms (engaging interdisciplinarity)
- practicing our art

### Liyan's Presentation


**Q1:** How much of the result was purely due to touching as a sense?

I think it is interesting to consider the difference between a robot touching a human and vice versa. Since touch is a very personal and intimate interaction, it is hard to predict how different people will react. Some people might feel safer & trusting if a robot touched them, while others might see this as an intusion on their personal space. I personally believe that a robot lightly touching my hand would make me feel more safe around it thus most likely lead me to trusting the robot more. This would probably happen because the touch would let me know that the robot acknowledges me and 'wants' to have a 'conversation' with me; that I'm not just interacting with a wall.

**Q2:** Why is people's immediate response to classify robots as untrustworthy?

I think this comes from our entertainment (films, movies and novels) and for the entertainment industry - this is just an easier story to sell. Furthermore, I truly believe that politics plays a bog role in this. There's been a lot of pushback from politicians when it comes to automizing production (which can be considered low-level robots) since they lead to a loss of jobs in the short run. Thus it is easy to villanize robots as the cause for loss of low-skilled jobs, however, this is no different than the industrial revolution. It scares people that their lives are about to significantly change and they might need to learn a new skill to stay in the workforce.

For the follow-up question that lead from the conversation of how would you react if you met someone, developed a relationship and then found out they were a robot, would anything change?

I think this (to a very, very large extent) depends on how normalized this has become in the society at that point in time.

What comes to mind is the robot Instagram model [Miquela](https://www.instagram.com/lilmiquela/?hl=en), who became a sensation because people couldn't figure out if she was a robot or a person. When people finally found out, I think they simply lost interest. So maybe this is a sign that we are ready for such antromorphic beings in our lives.

**Q3 & Q4:** To what degree were the experiments held in a setting favorable to care giving? What if it wasn't a game?

One mistake made by a robot would lead to a drastic loss of trust in them because of the level of expectation we have from robots. It's different in a game, but in a real life situation we wouldn't forgive a robot even though, technically, every robot is a product of a human thus susceptible to human error. If a robot makes a mistake, it is because the code was written wrong or the hardware wasn't completely foolproof. Interestingly, whenever I am met with a robo advisor, I get extremely frustrated and do everything in my power to get to speak to a human.

**Q5:** How willing are you to forgive a robot? How much accountability do they hold?

I wouldn't blame the robot, I would blame the people who made it or control it.

Something that I thought of as well - is trust universal or is it something personal and changes person to person? If you trust the company or government building the robot, are you more likely to trust the robot and thus forgive its mistakes? Does it need to come from an initial trust and ability to forgive the people / organization behind the robot?

Communication with the robot - antromorphised as well; trusting someone/ something more if you can communicate with it.
